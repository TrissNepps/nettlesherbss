                                by step through pregnancy, birth, and postpartum. A doula is there for informational, physical,

                                Childbirth is a transformational process for every woman and the unfortunate truth is that in
                                today’s world the amount of support is severely lacking. I wish to see every woman have a
                                doula there by her side, guiding her and reassuring her of her power; for birth should be an
                                empowering experience, not something to be afraid of. <br><br>

                                Yoni steams have been a practice worldwide for centuries. Historical findings document women
                                using steam as a healing aid for reproductive health, to hasten labor, to help with
                                postpartum recovery, and every day women’s ailments. To see a map of where and how
                                vaginal steaming was used throughout the world, visit <strong><a href="steamychick.com" target="_blank">steamychick.com.</a></strong><br><br>
                               
                                Steaming is recommended immediately once a mother stops bleeding bright red postpartum blood.
                                After a woman gives birth her body must shed the superficial mucous membrane that lines her
                                uterus during pregnancy; therefore she will have discharge consisting of this membrane, as well
                                as lochia, for weeks. <br><br>
                                Yoni steams are a gentle way to assist healing for the new mother, as well as a way to fully
                                cleanse the womb space. Some of the medicinal benefits include: <br>
                                <strong>Vaginal discharge/lochia completely disappearing at a faster rate than those who don’t
                                    steam.</strong> <br><br>
                                <strong>The uterus shrinks and goes back into place at a quicker rate.</strong> <br><br>
                                <strong>Resolved vaginal prolapse.</strong> <br><br>
                                <strong>Speedy recovery of any vaginal tearing from birth.</strong> <br><br>
                                By steaming postpartum you are enabling the steam to gently heal any birth injuries, as well as
                                cleanse your womb space and vaginal canal. <br><br>
                                According to a recent study of postpartum women using vaginal steam to facilitate
                                healing, vaginal steaming has a positive impact on
                                many of the indicators of postpartum recovery, particularly in the areas of lowering blood

                            <span class="menu__detail">Bengkung Belly binding is the process of wrapping a new mom with a fabric measuring about
                                15-16 ft long from her hips to just below her breasts. This method of self care has roots in many
                                cultures, & has been practiced for centuries. <br><br>
                                The benefits that have been reported from belly binding include: <br>
                                <strong>Breastfeeding support</strong><br>
                                The wrap makes it difficult to slouch which is common when breastfeeding. <br><br>
                                <strong>Core support</strong><br>
                                Binding helps to bring the abdominal muscles back together if there is any diastasis recti
                                present. <br><br>
                                <strong>Lower back support</strong><br>
                                Strong core, strong lower back. <br><br>
                                <strong>Pelvic floor support</strong><br>
                                Aids in keeping those pelvic muscles together after naturally loosening during birth. <br><br>
                                <strong>Emotional support</strong><br>
                                Belly binding is a form of self care for the new mother ~ honoring her, as well as wrapping her
                                up to provide support & comfort. <br><br>
                                <strong>Physical support</strong><br>
                                Binding aids the organs & uterus in returning back to their position pre birth, as well as assists
                                with the dispelling of postpartum bleeding & lochia loss with the constant, gentle pressure. <br><br>
                                <strong>Postpartum waist girth</strong><br>
                                The pressure from the wrap assists in ridding any water retention or swelling postpartum, as
                                well as providing shape & support for the body. <br><br>
